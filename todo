ESTIMATED TIMELINE
==================
Phase 1: 2-3 weeks    (you are here)
Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
Phase 3: 4-6 weeks
Phase 4: 3-4 weeks
Phase 5: 3-4 weeks
Phase 6: 6-8 weeks
Phase 7: 4-6 weeks
Phase 8: 2-3 weeks

Total: ~6-9 months for full engine

PRIORITY SHORTCUTS
==================
If building a specific game, skip:
- Terrain editor (if not open world)
- Networking (if single player)
- Advanced AI (if simple enemies)
- Material graph (use code instead)

Minimum viable engine for a 3D game:
- Rendering ✓
- Animation
- Basic physics
- Simple scripting
- Scene save/load
- Audio
- Build export
